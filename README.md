Kerberos is a simple Gtk4 based lock screen for wayland compositors. It is tested on [Wayfire](https://wayfire.org/) but should work on simular system as well (check dependencies).

### Whats Kosy? Kosy Team?
I (*mfxbe*) use Kosy as a project name for number of applications I've written for personal use with a specific design and structur in mind. Right now Kerberos is the only one being available in public. Other might or might not be released in future.
